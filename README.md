## Installation

Slidify is not on CRAN and needs to be installed from `github` using the `devtools` package.

```S
pkgs <- c("slidify", "slidifyLibraries", "rCharts")
devtools::install_github(pkgs, "ramnathv")
```

While the installation process from `github` is relatively painless for Mac/Linux/Ubuntu users, it can make Windows users jump through hoops. For those of you on Windows that hit a bottleneck, here is an [excellent blog post](http://thiagosilva.wordpress.com/2013/02/17/installing-slidify-on-a-windows-machine/) that takes you through an alternate installation process that has been reported to work well.
